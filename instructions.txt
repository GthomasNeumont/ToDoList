* The FubuRegistry class is ToDoListFinalFubuRegistry.  Use this class to register custom policies or
  configure FubuMVC application settings




* StructureMap configuration is in the file ToDoListFinalRegistry
* StructureMap's default 'IFoo is Foo' conventions are configured for this project

The FubuMVC application is defined in the ToDoListFinalApplication class.  It's unlikely that you'll
need to customize the application bootstrapping, but ToDoListFinalApplication is where that would
happen.  You will want to refer to this class later if you use multiple forms of hosting (ASP.Net, 
Katana, or Serenity).


* The default '/' route calls the HomeEndpoint.Index() method.  
* Change that method to eliminate these ugly textual instructions with something useful;)
